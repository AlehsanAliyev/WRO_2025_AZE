Our robot has one Arduino Nano as the main controller. It uses an L298N motor driver to control a DC motor. Steering is done with a servo motor, where the rear axle is used for steering and the front axle for driving. We have two IR sensors in the front and one in the back to detect obstacles. A TCS3200 color sensor is used to detect blue and orange lines and turn in the desired directions. We are also going to add a Raspberry Pi 5 with a USB camera for traffic sign detection and parking. The robot is powered by two 11.1 V Li-Po batteries.
